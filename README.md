# PDFto4HANDOUTS #

Lazy, slow and ugly Applescript that uses the Preview's "Print" dialog to print a pdf with 4 pages per sheet of the pdf you use as input. This is all UI scripted, so you see every step it takes happening on your screen.

## Changelog 19/2/2015 ##
- Added Mac App. Just drag and drop PDF's onto app. Crashes sometimes if you have a slow computer.. Like me.
